## **Abstract**  
This project involves the design and implementation of a microservice-based Digital-Asset Marketplace Application that allows users to create, trade, and manage digital assets. The microservice architecture ensures scalability, modularity, and ease of maintenance. The application comprises the following services:  
1. **Authentication Service**  
2. **Digital-Asset Management Service**  
3. **Payment Service**  
4. **Marketplace Service**  

These services are independently deployable and leverage containerization (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes) for efficient deployment and high availability.

## **Introduction**  

### **Overview of the Application**  
The NFT Marketplace Application allows users to:  
- Create digital assets and store their metadata.  
- List digital assets for sale in the marketplace.  
- Process payments for purchases using cryptocurrency (CSDP Token).  
- Securely authenticate and authorize user actions.  

### **Problem Statement**  
Traditional monolithic systems face challenges such as:  
- Independent service scalability.  
- Deployment delays.  
- Maintenance difficulties as the application grows.  

By adopting a microservices architecture, these issues are mitigated, enabling faster development cycles and independent scaling of individual services.

### **Why Microservices?**  
- **Independent Scaling**: Services scale independently based on resource demands.  
- **Modularity**: Clear separation of concerns for better maintainability and debugging.  
- **Faster Deployments**: Updates to one service donâ€™t impact others.  
- **Technology Flexibility**: Each service can use the most appropriate stack or tools.

## **Application Architecture**  

### **High-Level Architecture**  
- **Microservices and Interconnections**:  
  - Authentication, Digital-Asset Management, Payment, and Marketplace services.  
  - REST APIs for synchronous communication.  
  - RabbitMQ for asynchronous communication.  
- **External Integrations**: Blockchain for NFT minting and CSDP token-based payments.  

### **Microservices Overview**  
1. **Authentication Service**:  
   - User management: Registration, login, logout.  
   - Token-based authentication using JWT.  

2. **Digital-Asset Service**:  
   - Creation and minting of digital assets.  
   - Metadata storage (title, description, image link).  
   - Blockchain integration for minting and token storage.  
   - Querying user-owned NFTs.  

3. **Payment Service**:  
   - Processes payments by interacting with blockchain smart contracts.  
   - Supports cryptocurrency transfers and token-based payments.  

4. **Marketplace Service**:  
   - Lists NFTs for sale.  
   - Authenticates and authorizes users via the Authentication Service.  
   - Manages buying, selling, and asset statuses.  
   - Coordinates with the Digital-Asset and Payment services.

## **Design Approach**  

### **Decomposition Strategy**  
- Core functionalities were separated into independent microservices using the **Strangler Pattern**.  
- Shared Database Pattern was used for simplified data management since no sensitive data needed hiding between services.  

### **Database Design**  
- **Authentication Service**: Stores user credentials, roles, and tokens.  
- **Digital-Asset Service**: Manages NFT metadata and blockchain references.  
- **Payment Service**: Logs transactions and payment details.  
- **Marketplace Service**: Tracks NFT listings, bids, and sale status.

### **Communication Between Services**  
- **REST APIs**: Synchronous communication for user validation and data retrieval.  
- **Message Queue (RabbitMQ)**: Asynchronous communication for ownership changes after purchase.

---

## **Scalability**  
- Independent scaling for resource-intensive services like Digital-Asset and Payment services.  
- Traffic-heavy operations (e.g., NFT minting) benefit from dedicated scaling.
